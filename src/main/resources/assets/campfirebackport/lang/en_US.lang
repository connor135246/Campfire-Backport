campfirebackport.config.explanation.65=# EnviroMine Compatibility
campfirebackport.config.explanation.66=If you're using EnviroMine and want to have campfires warm you up, you can set it up using EnviroMine's config.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.67=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.68=Quick Method:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.69=1. Download "campfirebackport.cfg" from the github, which has some basic settings for campfires.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.70=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connor135246/Campfire-Backport/master/enviromine/campfirebackport.cfg
campfirebackport.config.explanation.71=2. Go to your "config" folder in your ".minecraft".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.72=3. Go to "enviromine", then "profiles", then "default", then "CustomProperties".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.73=4. Put "campfirebackport.cfg" there.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.74=5. Launch Minecraft with EnviroMine and Campfire Backport. Campfires will now warm you up.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.75=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.76=Manual Method:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.77=1. Launch Minecraft with EnviroMine and Campfire Backport.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.78=2. Go to EnviroMine's config.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.79=3. Go to "Profile Settings" -> "default_Settings.cfg" -> "Config" and set "Generate Blank Configs" to "true". 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.80=When you click done, EnviroMine will generate configs for all of your mods and set the option back to "false". This can take a while if you have a lot of mods! But once it's done, you'll be able to configure everything you want for every mod you have.  
campfirebackport.config.explanation.81=Now that EnviroMine has generated default settings for campfires, you can enable temperature. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.82=4. Go to "Custom Configs" -> "campfirebackport.cfg" -> "blocks". 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.83=5. For lit campfires, open "tile_campfire_campfire". For lit soul campfires, open "tile_soul_campfire_soul_campfire". For lit foxfire campfires, open "tile_foxfire_campfire_foxfire_campfire". For lit shadow campfires, open "tile_shadow_campfire_shadow_campfire".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.84=I'd recommend setting the campfires to the same values as torches. That would be "Enable Temperature" to "true", "Temperature" to "75.0", and "Air Quality" to "-0.25". You could also set "Sanity" to "0.1" for regular campfires (since they're meant to be cozy) and "-0.1" for soul campfires (since that's the value for Soul Sand).

campfirebackport.config.explanation.107=# v1.9 Recipe Changes
campfirebackport.config.explanation.108=This section is for people who have used Campfire Backport before v1.9.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.109=There are a couple changes to recipes in this update that may require you to update your scripts.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.110=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.111=First, container items.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.112=Some items in minecraft have container items associated with them. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.113=For example, filled buckets have their container items set as empty buckets. That's why when you craft a cake, you get back empty buckets while the milk is used up.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.114=As of v1.9, campfire recipes and campfire extinguishers/ignitors will take care of these for you.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.115=For example, in previous versions you might make a campfire extinguisher that has a water bucket as the input and an empty bucket as the output.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.116=If you used the same extinguisher in the current version, you would end up with 2 empty buckets.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.117=If you had any recipes that explicitly return empty buckets or bottles or similar items, chances are they'll now return 2 items and have to be changed.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.118=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.119=Second, water containers.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.120=One of the default extinguishers in the config now works dramatically differently.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.121=It allows items to extinguish campfires if they contain at least 1000 mB of water.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.122=Previously, it worked on some (but not all) items that can hold fluids as NBT. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.123=As of v1.9, it works on all items that can hold fluids as NBT, as well as any bucket or bottle that holds a fluid.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.124=If you had any recipes that use an item that contains water, you may not need them anymore.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.125=For example, if another mod adds an alternative bucket such as a clay bucket which can also hold water, it will likely work with the default config extinguisher.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.126=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.127=Finally, there are some new CraftTweaker things you can do.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.128=Campfire Backport now supports Item Transformers (https://docs.blamejared.com/1.12/en/Vanilla/Items/Item_Transformers/). Previously, they weren't supported.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.129=You can also take a look at # [Working with NBT Tags in CraftTweaker] and # [Working with Fluid Containers in CraftTweaker].

campfirebackport.config.explanation.136=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.137=# Recipes Overview
campfirebackport.config.explanation.138=You can add custom cooking recipes and custom extinguishers/ignitors to the campfire. There are some already added in the config by default.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.139=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.140=CraftTweaker:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.141=You can add # [Campfire Cooking Recipes] and # [Campfire Extinguishers / Ignitors] with CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.142=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.143=Config:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.144=You can add # [Campfire Cooking Recipes] and # [Campfire Extinguishers / Ignitors] in the config without CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.145=Note: In the config, you add recipes and extinguishers/ignitors separately for regular and soul campfires. To reduce the need for copy-pasting, the "Inheritance" config options make one type of campfire inherit config recipes from the other.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.146=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.147=There are also some config options related to recipes that can't be changed from CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.148=-Auto Recipe Discovery: automatically adds furnace recipes that make food to the campfire's recipes.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.149=-Auto Recipe Discovery Blacklist: blacklist particular inputs from Auto Recipe Discovery.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.150=-Default Cooking Times: the default cooking time for recipes that don't specify a cooking time.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.151=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.152=By default, a few cooking recipes and extinguishers/ignitors are defined in the config. Also, Auto Recipe Discovery is turned on.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.153=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.154=Removing Recipes:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.155=You can't remove recipes with CraftTweaker. To remove the default recipes, you have to delete them from the config.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.156=-Default cooking recipes are defined in Custom Recipes (Regular). Cooking recipes are also added by Auto Recipe Discovery which defaults to "both".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.157=-Default extinguishers are defined in Custom Extinguishers (Regular).
campfirebackport.config.explanation.158=-Default ignitors are defined in Custom Ignitors (Regular).
campfirebackport.config.explanation.159=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.160=Tips:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.161=-Pressing the "uses" hotkey when hovering over a campfire in NEI will bring up all Recipes and Extinguishers / Ignitors.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.162=-Cooking times in NEI are rounded to an easily readable number of seconds or minutes. Holding Shift will display times in exact ticks.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.166=# Burn Out Overview
campfirebackport.config.explanation.167=Burn out is a mechanic where campfires will extinguish on their own after a certain amount of time. It's disabled by default.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.168=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.169=CraftTweaker:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.170=You can add # [Burn Out Biome / Dimension Timers] with CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.171=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.172=Config:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.173=You can add # [Burn Out Biome / Dimension Timers] in the config without CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.174=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.175=There are many config options related to burn out that can't be changed from CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.176=-Burn Out Timers: the default burn out timers when no biome/dimension timers apply.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.177=-Put Out by Rain: whether campfires will burn out if they're being rained on for a little while.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.178=-Burn Out (Signal Fires): whether campfires will burn out from timers or rain even if they're signal fires.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.179=-Burn to Nothing Chances: the chance that campfires will be destroyed when they burn out.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.180=-Burn Out As An Item: whether campfires will count down their burn out timers even as an item in your inventory.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.181=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.182=By default, all of these settings related to burn out are disabled.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.183=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.184=If you're thinking of trying out burn out timers, you may also want to take a look at the following config options: Unlit by Default, Remember Lit/Unlit State, Silk Touch Needed, and Signal Fire Blocks.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.185=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.186=Tips:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.187=-Make sure you put your biome/dimension timers in order of highest priority to lowest priority. Campfires will use the first applicable timer to set their burn out timer. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.188=-If no timers apply, campfires will use the value from the Burn Out Timers config option. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.189=-You'll be able to see the currently applicable burn out timer in NEI under Extinguishers / Ignitors.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.190=-WAILA will show a tooltip if the campfire you're looking at is currently burning out. The message changes depending on how long is left.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.191=-You can reignite campfires that are currently burning out using any Campfire Ignitor. This resets their burn out timer.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.192=-If you change a burn out timer, campfires that are already in the world won't realize immediately. Break and place them again for them to update.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.193=-If you don't know your biome/dimension IDs, the command "/campfirebackport locationinfo" will tell you the IDs of your current dimension and biome.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.194=Also, there are mods such as Tell Me that will output a complete list of biome IDs for you. Dimension IDs can be found in your saves. Note that some mods allow you to change biome or dimension IDs in their config.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.195=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.196=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.197=# Campfire Backport CraftTweaking
campfirebackport.config.explanation.198=Campfire cooking recipes, campfire extinguishers/ignitors, and burn out biome/dimension timers can be made with CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.199=Note that you'll need at least CraftTweaker v3.1.0. Errors may occur with earlier versions.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.200=Tips:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.201=-When using a damageable item as an input, don't forget to set its damage as a wildcard. For example, <minecraft:iron_sword> only applies to undamaged iron swords, but <minecraft:iron_sword:*> applies to iron swords with any amount of damage.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.202=-If you want to use NBT tags in your recipe inputs, check out # [Working with NBT Tags in CraftTweaker].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.203=-If you want to use fluids in your recipe inputs, check out # [Working with Fluid Containers in CraftTweaker].

campfirebackport.config.explanation.416=In most cases, it'll be easier and cleaner to do these with CraftTweaker.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.417=Tips:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.418=-Check the console for error messages if your input didn't parse! 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.419=-If a mod adds an item with unusual characters in its id, the in-game config GUI may prevent you from entering it. In that case, you'll have to edit the config file directly.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.420=-The NBT modifier doesn't check for valid NBT formatting! All it checks is that there's something between two {} curly brackets. Error messages will be printed to console if your NBT failed to parse.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.421=-Recipes and Extinguishers/Ignitors are sorted based on their input. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.422=Recipes created by Auto Recipe Discovery are lowest, followed by Data inputs, followed by Class inputs, followed by tool class inputs, followed by Ore Dictionary inputs, followed by Item inputs that don't specify a meta, followed by Item inputs that do.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.423=Within each of these categories, inputs with NBT data have higher priority, and inputs that use more than one item have the most priority.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.424=When you try to use an item on a campfire, it will use whatever recipe matches first. (Also, Recipes are checked before Extinguishers/Ignitors.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.425=This allows you to have, for example, an Ore Dictionary recipe that applies to every logWood, but allows you to override it for specific item in logWood if you'd like.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.426=Check the order of your recipes by viewing recipes in NEI, or setting the config option #Debug: Print Campfire Recipes to true.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.485=It can be "left" or "right", for left click or right click.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.492=For example, if you add "+dispensable" to a fire charge, dispensers will no longer fire them as projectiles.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.493=This is just because of the way dispenser behaviours work in minecraft.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.497=Also, dispenser behaviours are registered before any CraftTweaker scripts are run!

campfirebackport.config.explanation.534=For example, "biome:4&dimension:-1".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.535=-The third section is the number of ticks until the campfire will burn out. 20 ticks is 1 second.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.536=Like in the Burn Out Timers config option, setting it to -1 prevents the campfire from burning out.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.537=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.538=Some example timers:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.539=-Soul campfires never burn out in the nether
campfirebackport.config.explanation.540=    soul/dimension:-1/-1
campfirebackport.config.explanation.541=-Regular campfires burn out after around a minute in swamp biomes
campfirebackport.config.explanation.542=    regular/biome:6/1200
campfirebackport.config.explanation.543=-All campfires burn out immediately in ocean biomes that are in the nether
campfirebackport.config.explanation.544=    both/biome:0&dimension:-1/0
campfirebackport.config.explanation.545=-Regular campfires burn out after around an hour in mushroom island biomes that are in the end
campfirebackport.config.explanation.546=    regular/dimension:1&biome:14/72000
campfirebackport.config.explanation.547=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.548=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.549=# [Campfire Drops]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.550=These use the same format as # [Custom Output] (see below).
campfirebackport.config.explanation.551=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.552=---
campfirebackport.config.explanation.553=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.554=# General Formats
campfirebackport.config.explanation.555=# [Custom Input]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.556=-It can be based on a namespaced Item, an Ore Dictionary entry, a tool class, a Java Class, or NBT.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.557=-Namespaced Items are in the format "modid:name:metadata".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.558=The ":metadata" part is optional. If it isn't there, any metadata of the item will work.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.559=For example, minecraft:sand refers to both Sand and Red Sand, but minecraft:sand:0 refers to only Sand.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.560=-Ore Dictionary entries are in the format "ore:oreName".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.561=For example, ore:logWood refers to anything registered in the logWood ore.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.562=-Tool classes are in the format "tool:toolClass".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.563=There are 3 vanilla tool classes: pickaxe, shovel, and axe. Simply type tool:pickaxe or tool:shovel or tool:axe.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.564=Modded tool classes work as well.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.565=-Java Classes are more technical. They refer to the actual Java Class used by an item or block.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.566=You may have to dip into the vanilla code or the github of other mods to get it. It has to be a full package and class name, prepended by "class:".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.567=For example, class:net.minecraft.item.ItemSword refers to any item that uses the ItemSword Class or extends it, which includes all vanilla swords.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.568=Another example, class:net.minecraft.block.BlockStairs, refers to any block that uses the BlockStairs Class or extends it, which includes all vanilla stairs.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.569=Mods usually will extend the vanilla classes, especially for things like swords and armor. That's the main intended use.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.570=There's no check here other than that the class exists, so you could technically do class:net.minecraft.item.Item to refer to every single item in the game, but I really wouldn't recommend it.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.571=-Next is the NBT, which can be attached to an Item/Ore/tool/Class or exist on its own. You can type it out exactly like you would in a command.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.572=For example, minecraft:diamond_pickaxe{display:{Name:"Super Pick"}}.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.573=Unfortunately, this modifier isn't very useful. That's because the NBT tag must match EXACTLY.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.574=For example, you might want to check for the Unbreaking enchantment on a Golden Shovel, so you type minecraft:golden_shovel{ench:[{id:34,lvl:1}]}.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.575=But this will refer to Golden Shovels whose only enchantment is Unbreaking at exactly level 1 without any other NBT.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.576=So some specific NBT things have been given a special format you can type it in to test in a more lenient way.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.577=For enchantments, that format is "[ench:id,minlevel]".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.578=For example, minecraft:golden_shovel[ench:34,1] refers to any Golden Shovel that has an Unbreaking enchantment of at least level 1, and may or may not have other NBT.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.579=Another special NBT format is the fluid format, for items that hold fluids: "[Fluid:"fluidname",MinAmount:minamount]".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.580=For example, ThermalExpansion:Tank[Fluid:"water",MinAmount:1000] will check for at least 1000 mB of water in a fluid tank item from Thermal Expansion.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.581=The last NBT format is even more special than the others. This one can only exist on its own, without an Item/Ore/tool/Class.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.582=It's the Tinker's Construct Modifiers format. It allows you to check whether a Tinker's tool has specific modifiers on it.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.583=This one's rather complicated, so it gets its own section. See # [Tinker's Construct Modifiers Format].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.584=By the way, NBT-only inputs will display in NEI as a written book. Hover over it to see what you want to know.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.585=-Lastly, there's the number of inputs. You can set it by adding "@number" to the end of your input.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.586=For example, minecraft:dye:4@64 or ore:ingotIron@15 or minecraft:stone_axe[ench:16,3]@4.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.587=It's set to 1 by default if not included.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.588=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.589=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.590=# [Custom Output]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.591=-It's based on a namespaced Item.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.592=-Namespaced Items are in the format "modid:name:metadata".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.593=The ":metadata" part is optional. If it isn't there, it defaults to 0.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.594=For example, minecraft:coal and minecraft:coal:0 both refer to coal, and minecraft:coal:1 refers to charcoal.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.595=Once you've typed out your namespaced Item, you can add optional modifiers to the recipe.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.596=-The first modifier is the NBT. Type it out exactly like you would in a command.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.597=For example, minecraft:diamond_pickaxe{display:{Name:"Super Pick"}}.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.598=Or you can use one of the special formats from # [Custom Input] (but NOT # [Tinker's Construct Modifiers Format]).
campfirebackport.config.explanation.599=For example, minecraft:stone_axe[ench:16,3].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.600=-The second modifier is the number of outputs. You can set it by adding @number to the end of your output.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.601=For example, minecraft:dye:4@2 or mineraft:iron_ingot@13 or minecraft:stone_axe[ench:16,3]@64.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.602=It's set to 1 by default if not included.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.603=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.604=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.605=# [Tinker's Construct Modifiers Format]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.606=I'd recommend using the mod TiC Tooltips to see more information about modifiers.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.607=-General Format:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.608=    [Tinkers:[I:{integer modifiers}B:{byte modifiers}F:{float modifiers}IA:{integer array modifiers}]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.609=Each section is optional, but they must be in the order Integer, Byte, Float, Integer Array.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.610=Each section can contain multiple modifiers separated by commas. But note that the sections themselves are not separated by commas!
campfirebackport.config.explanation.611=Below are the supported modifiers organized by section.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.612=-Integer Modifiers: These can be any integer, almost always positive. They will match items with the given value or greater.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.613=    HarvestLevel
campfirebackport.config.explanation.614=    MiningSpeed
campfirebackport.config.explanation.615=    Beheading
campfirebackport.config.explanation.616=    Fiery (25 Blaze Powder per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.617=    Necrotic (Called Life Steal in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.618=    Unbreaking (Called Reinforced in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.619=    Moss (Called Auto-Repair in the tooltip. Ball of Moss sets it to 3.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.620=-Byte Modifiers: These are 1 or 0, where 1 means true and 0 means false. They will match items with the exact value given.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.621=    Lava (Called Auto-Smelt in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.622=    Emerald (Called Durability +50% in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.623=    Diamond (Called Durability +500 in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.624=    SilkTouch (Called Silky in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.625=    Broken (Whether the tool is broken or not.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.626=    Flux (If the tool uses RF instead of durability.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.627=-Float Modifiers: These can be any decimal number. If positive, they will match items with the given value or greater. If negative, they will match items with the given value or smaller. If zero, they will match items with exactly zero.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.628=    Knockback (Goes up 0.1 at a time. 10 Pistons per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.629=    Shoddy (positive values indicate Stonebound, negative values indicate Jagged.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.630=-Integer Array Modifiers: These can be any integer, always positive. They will match items with the given value or greater.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.631=    Redstone (Called Haste in the tooltip. 50 Redstone per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.632=    ModAttack (Called Sharpness in the tooltip. 72 Quartz per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.633=    ModSmite (Called Smite in the tooltip. 36 Consecrated Soil per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.634=    ModAntiSpider (Called Bane of Arthropods in the tooltip. 4 Fermented Spider Eyes per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.635=    Lapis (Called Luck in the tooltip. Fortune for pickaxes, Looting for swords. 450 Lapis Lazuli is the maximum)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.636=Any arbitrary modifier from other mods should work as long as you put it in the correct section. The above modifiers will look nicer in NEI though.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.637=Some examples:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.638=-Matches any Tinker's Construct tool:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.639=    [Tinkers:[]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.640=-Matches any tool that's had at least one Blaze Powder added to it:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.641=    [Tinkers:[I:{Fiery:1}]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.642=-Matches any tool with Auto-Smelt:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.643=    [Tinkers:[B:{Lava:1}]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.644=-Matches any tool that isn't broken:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.645=    [Tinkers:[B:{Broken:0}]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.646=-Matches a tool that's Jagged, with at least one Redstone added to it, with a Diamond added to it, and with a Harvest Level of at least 1 (stone pickaxe level):
campfirebackport.config.explanation.647=    [Tinkers:[I:{HarvestLevel:1}B:{Diamond:1}F:{Shoddy:-1.0}IA:{Redstone:1}]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.648=-Matches a tool that's Stonebound 2, with Auto-Smelt, with Beheading 1 or greater, with a Ball of Moss added to it, with at least one full modifier of Fiery (25 Blaze Powder), and with at least half a modifier of Knockback (5 Pistons):
campfirebackport.config.explanation.649=    [Tinkers:[I:{Beheading:1,Moss:3,Fiery:25}B:{Lava:1}F:{Shoddy:2.0,Knockback:0.5}]]

campfirebackport.config.explanation.653=# Campfire Backport Mixin Config
campfirebackport.config.explanation.654=The config file "campfirebackportmixins.cfg" lets you toggle which mixins will be used. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.655=There's no in-game GUI for this config, and Minecraft must be restarted if you want to change the settings.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.656=If you're using the "nomixin" .jar of Campfire Backport (the version number ends with "+nomixin"), you will need a separate mixin mod such as UniMixins to launch the game. (https://github.com/LegacyModdingMC/UniMixins) 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.657=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.658=Here's an overview of the options in this file.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.659=-Mixins: 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.660=    Enable or disable all mixins
campfirebackport.config.explanation.661=-Vanilla Mixins:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.662=    EntityPotion - thrown splash potions will extinguish campfires near where they land
campfirebackport.config.explanation.663=    EntitySmallFireball - small fireballs (like those shot by blazes, or from dispensers with fire charges) will ignite campfires they hit
campfirebackport.config.explanation.664=    PathFinder - entities will try to avoid lit campfires when pathfinding, and will be able to path properly over unlit campfires
campfirebackport.config.explanation.665=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.666=Note: In order for mod compatibility mixins to be applied, the mod's .jar file has to be discovered before Minecraft launches.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.667=Avoid renaming mod .jar files! If the filename doesn't include the mod name (ignoring case) in it somewhere, the .jar will not be found by Campfire Backport and mixins can't be applied.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.668=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.669=-Witchery Mixins:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.670=    TileEntityCauldron - campfires will be able to heat up witch's cauldrons just like fire
campfirebackport.config.explanation.671=    TileEntityKettle - campfires will be able to heat up kettles just like fire
campfirebackport.config.explanation.672=    brews.EntitySplatter - the projectiles created by the Flame brew can ignite campfires
campfirebackport.config.explanation.673=    brews.Extinguish - the Extinguish brew can extinguish campfires
campfirebackport.config.explanation.674=    symbols.Aguamenti - the Aguamenti symbol can extinguish campfires
campfirebackport.config.explanation.675=    symbols.Incendio - the Incendio symbol can ignite campfires
campfirebackport.config.explanation.676=-Thaumcraft Mixins:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.677=    TileCrucible - campfires will be able to heat up crucibles just like fire and lava
campfirebackport.config.explanation.678=    TileThaumatorium - campfires will be able to heat up thaumatoriums just like fire and lava
campfirebackport.config.explanation.679=-Enable Early Mod Loading: 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.680=    Some mods need to be loaded early so mixins can be applied to them. Different mixin loaders handle this sort of thing in different ways. If your mixin loader can do it better than Campfire Backport, you may be able to disable this.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.681=    Applies to: Witchery
campfirebackport.config.explanation.682=-Skip Mod Checking:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.683=    If enabled, skips checking for mods before trying to apply mod compatibility mixins. Any mod mixins that are enabled will always try to apply, even if you don't have the target mod! If mod mixins aren't being applied for you, you could try turning this on.
