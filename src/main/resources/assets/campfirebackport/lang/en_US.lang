campfirebackport.config.comment.render_3d=Client-side option. If true, campfire items in your inventory will render as a 3D block instead of a 2D item.
campfirebackport.config.comment.charcoal=If true, regular campfires can be crafted only using charcoal. In vanilla either coal or charcoal can be used, but breaking campfires always drops charcoal. If for some reason you don't want players to be able to turn coal into charcoal, turn this on.
campfirebackport.config.comment.soul_soil=If true, soul campfires can be crafted only using soul soil from Netherlicious. In vanilla either soul sand or soul soil can be used, but breaking campfires always drops soul soil. If for some reason you don't want players to be able to turn soul sand into soul soil, turn this on. This won't do anything if Netherlicious isn't installed!
campfirebackport.config.comment.regen=Lit campfires of this type will periodically apply a regeneration effect to nearby players.
campfirebackport.config.comment.regen_settings=First value is regen level, from 0 to 31. Second value is the timer on the regen effect to apply (in ticks). Third value is the radius from the campfire, from 0 to 100. Fourth value is the time between each application of regeneration (in ticks). Varies a little bit around this value.
campfirebackport.config.comment.auto=Campfires of this type will look through every single furnace recipe to find ones that result in an ItemFood, and add those to its recipes list.
campfirebackport.config.comment.auto_blacklist=Prevents Auto Recipe Discovery from adding furnace recipes that use these inputs to the recipe list. It's pattern validated. Format is "ore:oreName" or "modid:name" or "modid:name:meta". If meta is not given, all metas of the item are blocked.
campfirebackport.config.comment.default_cooking_times=The cooking times (in ticks) for Auto Recipe Discovery recipes and for custom campfire recipes where the cooking time is not specified. The first value is for regular campfires, the second value is for soul campfires.
campfirebackport.config.comment.recipes=The list of Custom Recipes for the %s campfire. You can also make these with CraftTweaker. Check the wiki on github, or use the command "/campfirebackport dumpinfo", to learn how.
campfirebackport.config.comment.recipes_inheritance=Allows you to make campfires of one type inherit Custom Recipes from the other type. That way you don't have to type them all out twice.
campfirebackport.config.comment.spawnpointable=Campfires of this type can be right-clicked with an empty hand while holding sneak to set your spawn point. They must be lit. Credit: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/home-camp
campfirebackport.config.comment.burn_out_on_respawn=Campfires of this type will burn out when you use them to respawn. By default, signal fires won't burn out. See Burn Out (Signal Fires).
campfirebackport.config.comment.automation=Hoppers and other forms of automation will be able to insert items into this type of campfire from the sides.
campfirebackport.config.comment.default_unlit=The unlit version of this type of campfire is the default one, instead of the lit one. Breaking a campfire drops it in its unlit form instead of its lit form. Requires restarting Minecraft to change crafting recipes.
campfirebackport.config.comment.remember_state=Campfires of this type will remember the state they're in when broken and drop in the corresponding item form. As in, breaking a lit campfire always drops a lit campfire, and breaking an unlit campfire always drops an unlit campfire, regardless of the setting of Unlit by Default.
campfirebackport.config.comment.silk=Campfires of this type need Silk Touch to drop themselves when broken.
campfirebackport.config.comment.rained_out=Campfires of this type will be put out by rain. It's rather slow... By default, signal fires won't burn out. See Burn Out (Signal Fires).
campfirebackport.config.comment.works_underwater=Campfires of this type will stay lit even if there's water on top of them.
campfirebackport.config.comment.damaging=Campfires of this type will hurt entities that step on them. Sometimes it can be nice to know that your villagers won't kill themselves on the decor.
campfirebackport.config.comment.vis_costs=The vis costs of extinguishing/igniting a campfire with a wand when Thaumcraft is installed. The order of values is: Aqua cost for extinguishing regular campfires, Aqua cost for extinguishing soul campfires, Ignis cost for igniting regular campfires, Ignis cost for igniting soul campfires. Setting a value to zero disables it.
campfirebackport.config.comment.burn_out_timer=The amount of time, in ticks, until campfires burn out. Setting to -1 disables burn out and lets them last forever. The first value is the setting for regular campfires, the second value is the setting for soul campfires. Varies a little bit around the given values. By default, signal fires won't burn out. See Burn Out (Signal Fires).
campfirebackport.config.comment.burn_out_rules=Here, you can set biome- and dimension-specific timers for the Burn Out Timer. You can also make these with CraftTweaker. Check the wiki on github, or use the command "/campfirebackport dumpinfo", to learn how.
campfirebackport.config.comment.signals_burn_out=Campfires that are signal fires normally don't burn out due to Put Out by Rain, Burn Out Timers, or Burn Out on Respawn. This setting allows them to burn out anyway.
campfirebackport.config.comment.burn_to_nothing=The chance for a campfire block to be destroyed when it burns out due to Put Out by Rain, Burn Out Timers, or Burn Out on Respawn. When destroyed, campfires will drop their inventory and their drops from being broken without Silk Touch. 0.0 means a 0% chance and 1.0 means an 100% chance. The first value is the setting for regular campfires, the second value is the setting for soul campfires.
campfirebackport.config.comment.burn_out_as_item=Campfires of this type start burning out even before they're placed. They will count down their Burn Out Timer as an item in the player's inventory or as an item in the world. Note that the timer will pause if inside a container, but will catch up again to where it should be the next time it's in a player's inventory or is an item in the world.
campfirebackport.config.comment.signal_fire_blocks=The list of blocks that, when placed below a campfire, make it a signal fire. Smoke from signal fires rises higher than normal. It's pattern validated. Format is "ore:oreName" or "modid:name" or "modid:name:meta". If meta is not given, all metas of the block work.
campfirebackport.config.comment.campfire_drops=The items the campfire will drop when broken without Silk Touch. The first entry is for regular campfires and the second entry is for soul campfires. If you leave it empty or the item isn't found, the default items will be used instead. The default item for regular campfires is two charcoal. The default item for soul campfires is one soul sand. It's pattern validated. The general simple setup is "modid:name:meta@number", with ":meta" defaulting to 0 if not included, and "@number" defaulting to 1. Check the wiki on github, or use the command "/campfirebackport dumpinfo", to learn more.
campfirebackport.config.comment.colourful_smoke=When receiving redstone power, campfires of this type will have coloured smoke particles based on the block below them. (The colour is based on map colours.) Mix with custom Signal Fire Blocks for best results. Credit: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/colorful-campfire-smoke
campfirebackport.config.comment.dispenser_blacklist=Prevents these items from receiving dispenser behaviours from Custom Extinguishers/Ignitors that are dispensable. It's pattern validated. Format is "modid:name".
campfirebackport.config.comment.state_changers=The list of Custom %1$ss for the %2$s campfire. You can also make these with CraftTweaker. Check the wiki on github, or use the command "/campfirebackport dumpinfo", to learn how.
campfirebackport.config.comment.extinguishers_inheritance=Allows you to make campfires of one type inherit Custom Extinguishers from the other type. That way you don't have to type them all out twice.
campfirebackport.config.comment.ignitors_inheritance=Allows you to make campfires of one type inherit Custom Ignitors from the other type. That way you don't have to type them all out twice.
campfirebackport.config.comment.print_recipes=If true, prints the final list of all Custom Recipes, Custom Extinguishers/Ignitors, and Burn Out Biome/Dimension Timers when reloading the config.
campfirebackport.config.comment.suppress_errors=If true, warnings about invalid Custom Recipes, Auto Recipe Discovery Blacklist, Signal Fire Blocks, Burn Out Biome/Dimension Timers, Dispenser Behaviours Blacklist, and Custom Extinguishers/Ignitors won't print to console.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.41=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.42=# v1.9 Recipe Changes
campfirebackport.config.explanation.43=This section is for people who have used Campfire Backport before v1.9.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.44=There are a couple changes to recipes in this update that may require you to update your scripts.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.45=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.46=First, container items.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.47=Some items in minecraft have container items associated with them. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.48=For example, filled buckets have their container items set as empty buckets. That's why when you craft a cake, you get back empty buckets while the milk is used up.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.49=As of v1.9, campfire recipes and campfire extinguishers/ignitors will take care of these for you.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.50=For example, in previous versions you might make a campfire extinguisher that has a water bucket as the input and an empty bucket as the output.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.51=If you used the same extinguisher in the current version, you would end up with 2 empty buckets.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.52=If you had any recipes that explicitly return empty buckets or bottles or similar items, chances are they'll now return 2 items and have to be changed.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.53=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.54=Second, water containers.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.55=One of the default extinguishers in the config now works dramatically differently.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.56=It allows items to extinguish campfires if they contain at least 1000 mB of water.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.57=Previously, it worked on some (but not all) items that can hold fluids as NBT. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.58=As of v1.9, it works on all items that can hold fluids as NBT, as well as any bucket or bottle that holds a fluid.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.59=If you had any recipes that use an item that contains water, you may not need them anymore.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.60=For example, if another mod adds an alternative bucket such as a clay bucket which can also hold water, it will likely work with the default config extinguisher.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.61=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.62=Finally, there are some new CraftTweaker things you can do.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.63=Campfire Backport now supports Item Transformers (https://docs.blamejared.com/1.12/en/Vanilla/Items/Item_Transformers/). Previously, they weren't supported.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.64=You can also take a look at # [Working with NBT Tags in CraftTweaker] and # [Working with Fluid Containers in CraftTweaker].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.65=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.66=---
campfirebackport.config.explanation.67=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.68=# Campfire Backport CraftTweaking
campfirebackport.config.explanation.69=Campfire cooking recipes, campfire extinguishers/ignitors, and burn out biome/dimension timers can be made with CraftTweaker.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.320=It can be "signal" or "notsignal" or "any".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.321="signal" means the campfire must be a signal fire to cook the item.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.322="notsignal" means the campfire must NOT be a signal fire to cook the item.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.323="any" means it doesn't matter, which is the default.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.324=-The fifth section is the byproduct # [Custom Output] (see below), which is optional. It's simply another output that can have a chance to be produced.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.325=-The sixth section is the byproduct chance, which is optional. It's a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the chance for the byproduct.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.326=If byproduct chance is not given, it defaults to 1.0 (100%).

campfirebackport.config.explanation.363=# [Campfire Extinguishers / Ignitors]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.364=-There are 3 sections to this one. Separate each section with a /.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.365=-The first section is the way this extinguisher / ignitor can be used.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.366=It can be "left" or "right", for left click or right click.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.367=Since right clicking a campfire checks for cooking recipes first, you might want to set this to "left" if the input is also a cooking recipe input.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.368=Additionally, you can add "+dispensable" to make this extinguisher/ignitor work in a dispenser as well. More on this in a second.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.369=-The second section is # [Custom Input] (see below), but there are some differences.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.370=If you added "+dispensable" to the first section, # [Custom Input] shouldn't be an NBT-only input.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.371=(If you do add "+dispensable" to an NBT-only input, it'll be treated as not having "+dispensable" and you'll get a warning in console.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.372=USE CAUTION when assigning "+dispensable", if the item you specify already has a dispenser behaviour, that behaviour will be overwritten.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.373=For example, if you add "+dispensable" to a fire charge, dispensers will no longer fire them as projectiles.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.374=This is just because of the way dispenser behaviours work in minecraft.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.375=IMPORTANT: Dispenser behaviours are ONLY registered when the game is loaded!
campfirebackport.config.explanation.376=When you add a dispensable recipe from the in-game config screen, it won't actually be dispensable until you quit and reload!
campfirebackport.config.explanation.377=In the same way, if you remove a dispensable recipe, it won't actually stop being dispensable until you quit and reload!
campfirebackport.config.explanation.378=-The third section is what should happen after extinguishing / igniting the campfire.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.379="damageable" means the item used will be damaged by the "@number" from the # [Custom Input].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.380="stackable" means the item used will be reduced in stack size by the "@number" from the # [Custom Input].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.381="none" means neither of these things will happen.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.382=Additionally, you can specify an item to be added to the inventory afterward by putting a >, and then a # [Custom Output] (see below).
campfirebackport.config.explanation.383=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.384=Some example extinguishers/ignitors:

campfirebackport.config.explanation.407=# [Burn Out Biome / Dimension Timers]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.408=-There are 3 sections to this one. Separate each section with a /.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.409=-The first section is the campfire types this timer applies to.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.410=Must be "regular", "soul", or "both".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.411=-The second section is the biome and/or dimension ID.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.412=Type "biome:id" or "dimension:id". 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.413=You can give both a biome and dimension ID at the same time, by putting an & between.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.414=For example, "biome:4&dimension:-1".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.415=-The third section is the number of ticks until the campfire will burn out. 20 ticks is 1 second.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.416=Like in the Burn Out Timers config option, setting it to -1 prevents the campfire from burning out.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.417=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.418=Some example timers:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.419=-Soul campfires never burn out in the nether
campfirebackport.config.explanation.420=    soul/dimension:-1/-1
campfirebackport.config.explanation.421=-Regular campfires burn out after around a minute in swamp biomes
campfirebackport.config.explanation.422=    regular/biome:6/1200
campfirebackport.config.explanation.423=-All campfires burn out immediately in ocean biomes that are in the nether
campfirebackport.config.explanation.424=    both/biome:0&dimension:-1/0
campfirebackport.config.explanation.425=-Regular campfires burn out after around an hour in mushroom island biomes that are in the end
campfirebackport.config.explanation.426=    regular/dimension:1&biome:14/72000
campfirebackport.config.explanation.427=
campfirebackport.config.explanation.428=Tips:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.429=-Make sure you put your timers in order of highest priority to lowest priority. Campfires will use the first applicable timer to set their burn out timer. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.430=-If no timers apply, campfires will use the value from the Burn Out Timers config option. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.431=-You'll be able to see the currently applicable burn out timer in NEI under Extinguishers / Ignitors.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.432=-If you change a burn out timer, campfires that are already in the world won't realize immediately. Break and place them again for them to update.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.433=-If you don't know your biome/dimension IDs, the command "/campfirebackport locationinfo" will tell you the IDs of your current dimension and biome. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.434=Also, there are mods such as Tell Me that will output a complete list of biome IDs for you. Dimension IDs can be found in your saves. Note that some mods allow you to change biome or dimension IDs in their config.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.441=    
campfirebackport.config.explanation.442=# General Formats
campfirebackport.config.explanation.443=# [Custom Input]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.444=-It can be based on a namespaced Item, an Ore Dictionary entry, a tool class, a Java Class, or NBT.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.445=-Namespaced Items are in the format "modid:name:metadata".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.446=The ":metadata" part is optional. If it isn't there, any metadata of the item will work.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.447=For example, minecraft:sand refers to both Sand and Red Sand, but minecraft:sand:0 refers to only Sand.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.448=-Ore Dictionary entries are in the format "ore:oreName".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.449=For example, ore:logWood refers to anything registered in the logWood ore.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.450=-Tool classes are in the format "tool:toolClass".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.451=There are 3 vanilla tool classes: pickaxe, shovel, and axe. Simply type tool:pickaxe or tool:shovel or tool:axe.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.452=Modded tool classes work as well.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.453=-Java Classes are more technical. They refer to the actual Java Class used by an item or block.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.454=You may have to dip into the vanilla code or the github of other mods to get it. It has to be a full package and class name, prepended by "class:".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.455=For example, class:net.minecraft.item.ItemSword refers to any item that uses the ItemSword Class or extends it, which includes all vanilla swords.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.456=Another example, class:net.minecraft.block.BlockStairs, refers to any block that uses the BlockStairs Class or extends it, which includes all vanilla stairs.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.457=Mods usually will extend the vanilla classes, especially for things like swords and armor. That's the main intended use.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.458=There's no check here other than that the class exists, so you could technically do class:net.minecraft.item.Item to refer to every single item in the game, but I really wouldn't recommend it.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.459=-Next is the NBT, which can be attached to an Item/Ore/tool/Class or exist on its own. You can type it out exactly like you would in a command.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.460=For example, minecraft:diamond_pickaxe{display:{Name:"Super Pick"}}.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.461=Unfortunately, this modifier isn't very useful. That's because the NBT tag must match EXACTLY.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.462=For example, you might want to check for the Unbreaking enchantment on a Golden Shovel, so you type minecraft:golden_shovel{ench:[{id:34,lvl:1}]}.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.463=But this will refer to Golden Shovels whose only enchantment is Unbreaking at exactly level 1 without any other NBT.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.464=So some specific NBT things have been given a special format you can type it in to test in a more lenient way.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.465=For enchantments, that format is "[ench:id,minlevel]".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.466=For example, minecraft:golden_shovel[ench:34,1] refers to any Golden Shovel that has an Unbreaking enchantment of at least level 1, and may or may not have other NBT.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.467=Another special NBT format is the fluid format, for items that hold fluids: "[Fluid:"fluidname",MinAmount:minamount]".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.468=For example, ThermalExpansion:Tank[Fluid:"water",MinAmount:1000] will check for at least 1000 mB of water in a fluid tank item from Thermal Expansion.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.469=The last NBT format is even more special than the others. This one can only exist on its own, without an Item/Ore/tool/Class.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.470=It's the Tinker's Construct Modifiers format. It allows you to check whether a Tinker's tool has specific modifiers on it.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.471=This one's rather complicated, so it gets its own section. See # [Tinker's Construct Modifiers Format].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.472=By the way, NBT-only inputs will display in NEI as a written book. Hover over it to see what you want to know.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.473=-Lastly, there's the number of inputs. You can set it by adding "@number" to the end of your input.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.474=For example, minecraft:dye:4@64 or ore:ingotIron@15 or minecraft:stone_axe[ench:16,3]@4.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.475=It's set to 1 by default if not included.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.480=-Namespaced Items are in the format "modid:name:metadata".
campfirebackport.config.explanation.481=The ":metadata" part is optional. If it isn't there, it defaults to 0.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.482=For example, minecraft:coal and minecraft:coal:0 both refer to coal, and minecraft:coal:1 refers to charcoal.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.483=Once you've typed out your namespaced Item, you can add optional modifiers to the recipe.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.484=-The first modifier is the NBT. Type it out exactly like you would in a command.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.485=For example, minecraft:diamond_pickaxe{display:{Name:"Super Pick"}}.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.486=Or you can use one of the special formats from # [Custom Input] (but NOT # [Tinker's Construct Modifiers Format]).
campfirebackport.config.explanation.487=For example, minecraft:stone_axe[ench:16,3].
campfirebackport.config.explanation.488=-The second modifier is the number of outputs. You can set it by adding @number to the end of your output.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.489=For example, minecraft:dye:4@2 or mineraft:iron_ingot@13 or minecraft:stone_axe[ench:16,3]@64.

campfirebackport.config.explanation.496=    [Tinkers:[I:{integer modifiers}B:{byte modifiers}F:{float modifiers}IA:{integer array modifiers}]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.497=Each section is optional, but they must be in the order Integer, Byte, Float, Integer Array.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.498=Each section can contain multiple modifiers separated by commas. But note that the sections themselves are not separated by commas!
campfirebackport.config.explanation.499=Below are the supported modifiers organized by section.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.500=-Integer Modifiers: These can be any integer, almost always positive. They will match items with the given value or greater.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.501=    HarvestLevel
campfirebackport.config.explanation.502=    MiningSpeed
campfirebackport.config.explanation.503=    Beheading
campfirebackport.config.explanation.504=    Fiery (25 Blaze Powder per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.505=    Necrotic (Called Life Steal in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.506=    Unbreaking (Called Reinforced in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.507=    Moss (Called Auto-Repair in the tooltip. Ball of Moss sets it to 3.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.508=-Byte Modifiers: These are 1 or 0, where 1 means true and 0 means false. They will match items with the exact value given.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.509=    Lava (Called Auto-Smelt in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.510=    Emerald (Called Durability +50% in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.511=    Diamond (Called Durability +500 in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.512=    SilkTouch (Called Silky in the tooltip.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.513=    Broken (Whether the tool is broken or not.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.514=    Flux (If the tool uses RF instead of durability.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.515=-Float Modifiers: These can be any decimal number. If positive, they will match items with the given value or greater. If negative, they will match items with the given value or smaller. If zero, they will match items with exactly zero.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.516=    Knockback (Goes up 0.1 at a time. 10 Pistons per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.517=    Shoddy (positive values indicate Stonebound, negative values indicate Jagged.)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.518=-Integer Array Modifiers: These can be any integer, always positive. They will match items with the given value or greater.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.519=    Redstone (Called Haste in the tooltip. 50 Redstone per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.520=    ModAttack (Called Sharpness in the tooltip. 72 Quartz per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.521=    ModSmite (Called Smite in the tooltip. 36 Consecrated Soil per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.522=    ModAntiSpider (Called Bane of Arthropods in the tooltip. 4 Fermented Spider Eyes per modifier slot)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.523=    Lapis (Called Luck in the tooltip. Fortune for pickaxes, Looting for swords. 450 Lapis Lazuli is the maximum)
campfirebackport.config.explanation.524=Any arbitrary modifier from other mods should work as long as you put it in the correct section. The above modifiers will look nicer in NEI though.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.525=Some examples:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.526=-Matches any Tinker's Construct tool:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.527=    [Tinkers:[]]

campfirebackport.config.explanation.530=-Matches any tool with Auto-Smelt:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.531=    [Tinkers:[B:{Lava:1}]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.532=-Matches any tool that isn't broken:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.533=    [Tinkers:[B:{Broken:0}]]
campfirebackport.config.explanation.534=-Matches a tool that's Jagged, with at least one Redstone added to it, with a Diamond added to it, and with a Harvest Level of at least 1 (stone pickaxe level):

campfirebackport.config.explanation.539=# Campfire Backport Mixin Config
campfirebackport.config.explanation.540=The config file "campfirebackportmixins.cfg" lets you toggle which mixins will be used. 
campfirebackport.config.explanation.541=There's no in-game GUI for this config, and Minecraft must be restarted if you want to change the settings.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.542=If you're using the no-mixins version of Campfire Backport (the version number ends with -NM), this file won't exist.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.543=Here's an overview of the mixins:
campfirebackport.config.explanation.544=-Vanilla Mixins
campfirebackport.config.explanation.545=    EntityPotion: thrown splash potions will extinguish campfires near where they land
campfirebackport.config.explanation.546=    EntitySmallFireball: small fireballs (like those shot by blazes, or from dispensers with fire charges) will ignite campfires they hit
campfirebackport.config.explanation.547=    PathFinder: entities will try to avoid lit campfires when pathfinding, and will be able to path properly over unlit campfires
campfirebackport.config.explanation.548=-Mod Mixins
campfirebackport.config.explanation.549=In order for mod compatibility mixins to be applied, the mod's .jar file has to be discovered before Minecraft launches.
campfirebackport.config.explanation.550=Avoid renaming mod .jar files! If the filename doesn't include the mod name (ignoring case) in it somewhere, the .jar will not be found by Campfire Backport and mixins can't be applied.
